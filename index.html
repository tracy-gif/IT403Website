			<p > <strong>Hiya, it's nice to meet ya! My name is 
			Tracy and I have a huge passion for art.</strong>
			</p>
			
			<p  > I plan on using this webpage to show case my illustrations!
			I've been drawing for just about as long as I can remember and I 
			think this would be a nice start in creating a personal portfolio
			where I can have other see my creations. <em> Pretty interesting huh? </em>
			</p>
			
			<h2 class = "title"> What to expect </h2>
			
			<p> I plan on also establishing a commissions portion on the website
			where you can contact me so that I can draw you or whatever you want 
			and a simple frequently asked questions <span class = "para" >&lpar; FAQ &rpar;</span> where I
			answer questions you probably have for an artist.
			
			<h2 class = "title"> Summary </h2>
