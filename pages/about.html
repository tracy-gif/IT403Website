			<p> My name is Tracy, I'm 19 years old and I'm currently a
				college student at UNH in the Applied Mathematics in 
				Computing program, who also has an interest in coding and
				digital design; because of  this I'm taking a class to
				gain a better understanding of HTML, CSS and networking. 
				Interested in taking the course?

			<h2 class = "title"> About my illustrations </h2>
			
			<p> I have been making art since I was 8 
				years old, so I've been drawing for 11 years, <em> can you 
				believe it? </em> I do a lot of digital work using Photoshop
				CS5, Paint Tool Sai, and an Intuos Pro Wacom tablet. I can
				also traditional work too, with a good fashioned old pencil 
				and paper, but I really enjoy doing work digitally.
			</p>

			<p> Other than drawing, I occasionally do graphic design pieces.
				I actually started doing graphic design in my computer classes
				in highschool. Most of the work there are done in the microsoft
				office programs. I also do some work in Photoshop CS5 where I can.
				<br/>
				I typically do things like:
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li> Invitations </li>
					<li> Flyers </li>
					<li> Small Banners </li>
					<li> and more! </li>
			
				</ul>

			<p> I also adore minimalism and modern looking graphics, websites, 
				fliers, buisness cards, etc &lpar; which is probably reflected 
				in my website &rpar; but I also enjoy dynamic, 
				creative designs and strive to find the happy medium
				between the two, that satisfies my admiration for both styles.
			</p>
			<h2 class = "title"> Inspiration </h2>	
			
			<p> Generally, I'm  heavily inspired by Japanese animation and animated styles.
				After all, these styles were my motivation to pick up a pencil
				and draw. Over time, I realized that my changed style &lpar; 
				even a tiny bit which might be hard to spot! &rpar; because 
				I&rsquo;m constantly experimenting and looking for a way to 
				create a style that I truly enjoying drawing with!
			</p>

			<p>
				Style-wise, I am inspired by so many artists in the art world,
				<em>too many to count!</em> One of my greatest inspirations however,
				is my cousin &lpar; who actually inspired me to make my website
				about my art&rpar;. If you're interested I highly suggest checking 
				out her work aswell!
