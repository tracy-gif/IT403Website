			<h3> Frequently Asked Questions </h3>
			
			<p> <strong>Q: What do you use to make your art? </strong><br/>
			A: I mostly use <a href = "https://www.systemax.jp/en/sai/">Paint Tool Sai</a>
			and <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html"> Photoshop </a> for making art
			and a <a href="https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/wacom-intuos-pro">
			wacom intuos pro small tablet </a> for actually drawing digitally.
			</p>
			
			<p> <strong>Q: Can I give you feedback during the commissioning process?</strong> <br/>
			A: Yes! I am here to draw something that you will love so I encourage any feedback.
			</p>
			
			<p> <strong>Q: How will I be able to see the process?</strong><br/>
			A: If you are the commissioner, all correspondence and WIP photo
			will be made via emails. Otherwise, the art may be posted in my gallery
			and can be seen there.
			</p>

			<p> <strong>Q: Can you do physical prints and send them through mail?</strong><br/>
			A: Unfortunately, as of right now, I do not make physical prints and the photos
			will be sent through mail. However, if you'd like to make a print of my art,
			I am fine with that, as long as you do not claim the art as your own or try to sell
			it for profit.
			</p>

			<p> <strong>Q: What if I want to request something you don't have listed as 
			available?</strong><br/>
			A: Feel free to contact me with any
			concerns you may have! If I don't have an answer listed on the website, the 
			best bet is to contactly me directly and I'll be happy to answer any burning 
			questions you may have. &#x263A;
